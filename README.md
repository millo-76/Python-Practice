## About

A repository for python practice and school assignments.

## Folder Structure
# Python Workspace

This workspace contains personal Python projects and course materials for INFS 3070. Local environment files (executables, DLLs, and virtual environments) may be present in the workspace but are ignored by Git via `.gitignore`. Only project code and notebooks in the tracked folders should be pushed to GitHub.

- Personal projects under `Personal Programs/`.
- Course materials for INFS 3070 under `INFS 3070/` (these are personal coursework and not for redistribution).

Notes:

- Put personal projects in `Personal Programs/` â€” use one subfolder per project.
- Course materials are under `INFS 3070/` and represent personal coursework.
- Local environment/runtime files (for example `python.exe`, `DLLs/`, `Lib/`, `include/`, `Scripts/`, `.venv/`) are local-only and ignored by Git.

## Personal Programs

Store standalone projects here. Each project should include a README and any environment instructions.

## INFS 3070

Course materials, weekly exercises, and assignment notebooks. See `INFS 3070/Weeks/` for per-week materials.

## How to run

1. Select a Python interpreter in VS Code that has the necessary packages installed.
2. To run a script with the workspace Python executable on Windows:

```powershell
"C:/Users/marja/OneDrive/Desktop/Code/Pyton Workspace/python.exe" path\\to\\script.py
```

3. To run notebooks, make sure `jupyter` and `ipykernel` are installed in the selected interpreter and choose that kernel in VS Code.

## Contributing

- Contributions are welcome for general projects. Do not modify submitted coursework under `INFS 3070/`.
